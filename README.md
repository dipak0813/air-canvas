AIR CANVAS USING OPENCV, MEDIAPIPE


Earlier painting was done using either a mouse or touch pad which was quite stressful and 
hectic task . Even though we have touch screen laptops , they are expensive . Hand 
tracking more specifically finger tracking technique is used as a tool of the computer 
acting as an external device similar to a keyboard and a mouse. It is used in various fields 
like Virtual Reality to sign language recognition .
Air Canvas is a hands-free digital drawing canvas which utilizes camera, opencv and 
mediapipe to recognize and map the hand gestures. The user finger is considered as the 
brush or the pen used to draw or annotate pdf. The size of brush can be modified , also the 
pen color can be changed by hovering pointer over built-in buttons. Computer vision 
techniques are used to draw different shapes. This system uses python language to built the 
code. Camera and Mediapipe is used to track the finger positions.
Computer Vision built in methods are used to draw shapes on the canvas or the area 
provided. We can annotate or edit pdf of our choice by opening the required pdf and 
hovering over the area where we need to annotate or underline. We can also save the 
canvas work as image. Python is one of the high-level-general-purpose programming 
language. Object-oriented approach mainly to help programmers to write clear, logical 
code for small as well as large â€“ scale projects.
In conclusion, the Air Canvas project is an exciting demonstration of the potential of 
computer vision and machine learning in creating innovative and intuitive applications. 
This project report will detail the development process of Air Canvas, from the initial 
concept to the final implementation, and provide a comprehensive analysis of the 
application's performance and usability.
